## Introduction
This is a Python script that implements a basic virtual assistant using speech recognition and text-to-speech technology. The virtual assistant can perform a number of tasks, including searching Wikipedia, opening websites, playing music, and telling the time.

## Dependencies
The script requires the following dependencies:
- SpeechRecognition
- Pyttsx3
- Wikipedia

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 wikipedia
```

## Usage
To run the script, simply open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the script is located, and type the following command:
```
python stage_1.py
```

After running the script, the virtual assistant will greet you and ask how it can assist you. You can then speak your commands, such as "open YouTube" or "what's the time?", and the virtual assistant will perform the corresponding tasks.

To exit the script, simply say "quit" or press Ctrl+C.
